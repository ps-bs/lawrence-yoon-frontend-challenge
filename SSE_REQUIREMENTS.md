# II Requirements

- App look like the mocks
- While there aren't designs for other breakpoints, does your app look decent at 768x1024 (iPad)?
- Have you added test coverage?
- Did you document any major challenges you encountered or major decisions you made and why?
- We need to know when a user that you have a conversation with is typing (just in the left sidebar, see the three dot icon in the mocks). This will require changes to `chat-backend`
- Product has also expressed interest in having chat rooms (_Channels_ in the mocks). Any user can join the channel once it's created. There aren't mocks for how to create a new chat room, but they have asked that it look and feel similar to creating a new conversation with one user. This will require changes to `chat-backend`
