# Chat app

You may use either `js` or `ts` (boilerplate found in the corresponding directories). You may use the boilerplate we are providing you for the frontend piece of this challenge or you may choose to scrap it. You may use any framework you wish (the boilerplate is [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)).

## The challenge

Assuming you use the boilerplate, there is a substantial amount of the work already done, but it still needs some love. Using [these mockups](https://www.figma.com/proto/v9fqT2hneqq5hnc4sYYQb4/Chat-App?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=5%3A3&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.03&scaling=scale-down-width), please make any necessary changes to get the app looking more like what the design team had in mind.

### Requirements

- [Software Engineer I/II Requirements](SE_REQUIREMENTS.md)
- [Senior Software Engineer I/II Requirements](SSE_REQUIREMENTS.md)

## Running the app

To start the boilerplate(s) run either `yarn ts` or `yarn js` from the root of the project.
